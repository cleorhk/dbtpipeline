# dbtpipeline
 This project is a comprehensive data pipeline designed to extract, transform, and load (ETL) data from various sources into a PostgreSQL database. It leverages dbt (data build tool) for managing SQL-based transformations and ensuring data quality, and integrates with other tools like Python for data extraction and Docker for containerization.
